## Indicator List
### DeltaGrid.js
**About**

This indicator plots the Volume, Delta and Cumulative Delta for each candle series on the chart. This plots as a sub-plot meaning it does not overlay on the main Candlestick chart.

### VolumeDeltaCandleInfo.js
**About**

This indicator shows only the Volume and Delta of an individual Candlestick series, however it plots it to the High of each Candle. This is an extension to DeltaGrid.js after seeing a similar implementation in Quantower. Unlike DeltaGrid.js, there are settings to adjust the size of the text as well as adjust the distance above the candle High.
